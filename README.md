ðŸ¤– Jenkins â€“ Open Source Automation Server

Jenkins is a popular open-source automation server used to automate the building, testing, and deployment of software projects.

- Written in Java and widely used for Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD).
- Supports hundreds of plugins to integrate with almost any tool in the DevOps pipeline.
- Easily extendable and customizable for complex workflows.

ðŸ§± Types of Jenkins Jobs
    âœ… Freestyle (for beginners/simple use)
     - Basic and flexible job type.
     - Supports shell scripts
     - Suitable for simple build/test/deploy.
    ðŸš€ Pipeline & Multibranch Pipeline (modern DevOps standard)
     - Allows defining the entire build lifecycle as code using a Jenkinsfile.
     - Written in Groovy-based DSL.
     - Supports parallel execution, conditions, and environment configs.

CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery / Deployment.

CI-Continuous Integration is a software development practise that automatically building,testing and integrating code from a repository. It is a process of merging all devoper working copies to a shared system serveral times a day to detect errors quickly.

CD-Continuous Delivery / Deployment: Practise of keeping a codebase in a deployable state. It enables frequest and automated deployment to a stage of production envirnonment.
 Stages:
  - Source stage
  - Build stage
  - Test stage
  - Deply stage
  - Monitor stage

ðŸ“Œ Two Types of Pipelines:
1. Declarative Pipeline
 - Simpler syntax, designed for beginners.
 - Structure-based and more readable.
2. Scripted Pipeline
